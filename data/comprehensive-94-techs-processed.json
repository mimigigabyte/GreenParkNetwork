    "description": "Prior-art approaches have used various turbine forms as Spherical, Helical or Darrieus for multiple commercial applications. Out of these forms, helical turbine offers many distinctive advantages such as unidirectional motion, reduced pulsation as well as increased operating power and strength. However, manufacturing of helical blades for such turbines is quite a costly and cumbersome affair. Due to this reason, many attempts have been made in the past to convert one turbine form into other, so as to create a novel design with all beneficial features, sidelining limitations. This novel approach enables development and use of a universal spherical turbine which works as a helical form (retaining its beneficial features) with spherical configuration.",

These measurements do not alter the material sample prior to measurement, allowing for more accurate data results and characterization. The device comprises a cavity for receiving the fluid, an auger connected with an axial shaft, and a load cell sensor connected to the auger. The sensor measures the force on the auger from the fluid as the auger moves up and down. A linkage interconnected to the sensor translates motion to the auger.",

    "description": "Researchers in Prof. Hongjie Dai's laboratory have combined graphene with metals and other inorganic elements to create a variety of hybrid materials that can be used for high performance electrocatalytic or electrochemical devices such as batteries and fuel cells. One type of hybrid material is formed from nanocrystals grown on graphene nanoplates or nanorods. This material is designed for use as an electrode for fast, efficient energy storage and conversion. Another type is formed from nanocrystals grown on reduced graphene oxide to produce high-performance, bi-functional catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A third type is a unique ORR catalyst formed from carbon nanotube-graphene complexes.",
