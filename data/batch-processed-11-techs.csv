Flexibile foundations for earthquake-proof offshore wind power,171988,J-Power,2025/04/30,2025/05/30,https://www.jpower.co.jp/english/,https://thumbnails.wipogreen.wipo.int/171988,"The 'Flexible Tripile' foundation addresses challenges posed by the shallow, hard bedrock common in Japanese waters, where traditional monopile foundations may be unsuitable. The new design consists of three piles connected to a central steel main pipe supporting the turbine tower via a base plate. This base plate incorporates square steel pipes, steel plates, and wire ropes, creating a flexible structure that deforms relatively easily. The design provides seismic isolation, allowing the turbine to sway slowly, preventing vibrations, and avoiding resonance-amplified oscillations during earthquakes. Joint research with Professor ISHIHARA Takeshi of the University of Tokyo and model experiments have, according to the company, confirmed the innovation's effectiveness and demonstrated the foundation's enhanced vibration damping compared to conventional designs.","Greenhouse gases, Electricity",N/A,日本,日本,Technology development / prototype (TRL 5-6),,海上风电;基础工程,地震防护海上风电柔性三桩基础,清洁能源技术,风能技术

Variable pitch turbine for homes,171985,ZONHAN,2025/04/30,2025/05/30,https://www.zonhan.com/en/product/5KW-Variable-Pitch-Wind-turbine.html,https://thumbnails.wipogreen.wipo.int/171985,"This small turbine is designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions, such as strong winds and cold temperatures, with a rated output of 5 kW at 10.5 m/s. Its tower is made from strong cast steel, and the reinforced blades feature a variable pitch mechanism ensuring stable and efficient operation even past the rated wind speed. This is passively activated as soon as wind speeds exceed 11 m/s, forcing the blades into a negative angle and thus limiting rotor rotation speed. This way, output power remains 5 kW at speeds up to 25 m/s, whereas start and security wind speeds are at 3 and 50 m/s, respectively.","Greenhouse gases, Electricity",N/A,,,,,叶片技术;小型风机,家用变桨距风力发电机,清洁能源技术,风能技术

Off grid wind and solar hybrid energy system,162189,PVMars Solar,2025/01/17,2025/01/23,https://www.pvmars.com/,https://thumbnails.wipogreen.wipo.int/162189,"Energy-storage hybrid wind-solar systems are customized based on the power needs, usage patterns, and local wind and sunlight conditions. These systems use wind and solar controllers for charging. Wind turbines above 3kW require a three-phase alternator, necessitating a separate controller to convert power to direct current. The battery pack serves as the common point for both power sources, making battery selection crucial. PVMARS offers gel and lithium battery options. For complete off-grid solutions, a recommended 3:1 ratio, such as a 3kW hybrid system with a 1kW wind turbine and 2kW solar panel, optimizes cost efficiency. A 1kW wind turbine produces an average of 1kWh per hour, storing energy alongside solar power in a battery bank. This ensures a consistent power supply for household devices like TVs, computers, lights, water heaters, refrigerators, and air conditioners.","Greenhouse gases, Electricity","The hybrid system reduces greenhouse gas emissions by utilizing renewable energy sources, thus contributing to a cleaner environment while providing reliable electricity for various household needs.",,,,,控制系统,离网风光混合能源系统,清洁能源技术,风能技术
