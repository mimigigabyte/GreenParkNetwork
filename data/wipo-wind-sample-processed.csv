171988,Flexible Tripile foundation for earthquake-proof offshore wind power,地震防护海上风电柔性三桩基础,J-Power,2025/04/30,2025/05/30,https://www.jpower.co.jp/english/,https://wipogreen.wipo.int/wipogreen-database/articles/171988/image,"The ""Flexible Tripile"" foundation addresses challenges posed by the shallow, hard bedrock common in Japanese waters, where traditional monopile foundations may be unsuitable. The new design consists of three piles connected to a central steel main pipe supporting the turbine tower via a base plate. This base plate incorporates square steel pipes, steel plates, and wire ropes, creating a flexible structure that deforms relatively easily. The design provides seismic isolation, allowing the turbine to sway slowly, preventing vibrations, and avoiding resonance-amplified oscillations during earthquakes.",Seismic isolation and vibration damping,,日本,日本,,,基础;塔架;三桩;单桩;振动;地震,清洁能源技术,风能技术
