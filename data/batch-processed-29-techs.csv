The new design consists of three piles connected to a central steel main pipe supporting the turbine tower via a base plate. This base plate incorporates square steel pipes, steel plates, and wire ropes, creating a flexible structure that deforms relatively easily. The design provides seismic isolation, allowing the turbine to sway slowly, preventing vibrations, and avoiding resonance-amplified oscillations during earthquakes. Joint research with Professor ISHIHARA Takeshi of the University of Tokyo and model experiments have, according to the company, confirmed the innovation's effectiveness and demonstrated the foundation's enhanced vibration damping compared to conventional designs.","Greenhouse gases, Electricity",N/A,日本,日本,Technology development / prototype (TRL 5-6),,海上风电;基础工程,地震防护海上风电柔性三桩基础,清洁能源技术,风能技术
