    "description": "The 'Flexible Tripile' foundation addresses challenges posed by the shallow, hard bedrock common in Japanese waters, where traditional monopile foundations may be unsuitable. The new design consists of three piles connected to a central steel main pipe supporting the turbine tower via a base plate. This base plate incorporates square steel pipes, steel plates, and wire ropes, creating a flexible structure that deforms relatively easily. The design provides seismic isolation, allowing the turbine to sway slowly, preventing vibrations, and avoiding resonance-amplified oscillations during earthquakes. Joint research with Professor ISHIHARA Takeshi of the University of Tokyo and model experiments have, according to the company, confirmed the innovation's effectiveness and demonstrated the foundation's enhanced vibration damping compared to conventional designs.",

Its tower is made from strong cast steel, and the reinforced blades feature a variable pitch mechanism ensuring stable and efficient operation even past the rated wind speed. This is passively activated as soon as wind speeds exceed 11 m/s, forcing the blades into a negative angle and thus limiting rotor rotation speed. This way, output power remains 5 kW at speeds up to 25 m/s, whereas start and security wind speeds are at 3 and 50 m/s, respectively.",

These systems use wind and solar controllers for charging. Wind turbines above 3kW require a three-phase alternator, necessitating a separate controller to convert power to direct current. The battery pack serves as the common point for both power sources, making battery selection crucial. PVMARS offers gel and lithium battery options. For complete off-grid solutions, a recommended 3:1 ratio, such as a 3kW hybrid system with a 1kW wind turbine and 2kW solar panel, optimizes cost efficiency. A 1kW wind turbine produces an average of 1kWh per hour, storing energy alongside solar power in a battery bank. This ensures a consistent power supply for household devices like TVs, computers, lights, water heaters, refrigerators, and air conditioners.",

The omnidirectional wind turbine remains stationary fixed at the same position and captures wind from all directions which is converted to mechanical energy and into a pulsing electric current. This wind turbine is more constant having a larger blade surface like a wall in the wind. Producing the same amount of current as existing wind turbines, this while smaller in size. Because of the larger blade surface. The wind turbine does not kill birds that sit on the turbine housing. The wind turbine is more economical, more safer. The wind turbine has many more features and advantages. Please see my patent application for more technical details. WO2023/147893",

    "description": "A wind turbine generator, in order to maintain an appropriate rotation speed of the rotor, electric energy to be taken out from the generator is regularly controlled according to the wind strength. In this control process, the torque of the rotor may fluctuate and become a vibration source. As the rotor is located on the tower which is elongate and low in rigidity, when the vibration caused by a fluctuation in torque synchronizes with the resonance frequency of the tower, the vibration may develop into a vibration of the entire windmill. Besides the fluctuation in torque due to rotation control of the rotor, vibration of a windmill is caused by various types of vibrations such as vibration due to a Karman vortex generated by the tower, resonance of the speed-increasing gear, the rotor, the generator and the drive axis, and vibration due to bending or torsion of the construction. The present technology provides a wind turbine generator that can control fluctuations in the torque loaded on the rotor to suppress or prevent wind turbine vibration.",

In particular, if a wind turbine is increased in size, since the percentage of lightning damage to a blade is increased, countermeasures against the lightning strikes of the blade are important. Therefore, the countermeasures against the lightning strikes for preventing the lightning strike are performed to the blade by providing a lightning receiving section (tip receptor) in a tip of the blade in addition to the receptor.",
