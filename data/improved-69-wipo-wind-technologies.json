    "description": "Prior-art approaches have used various turbine forms as Spherical, Helical or Darrieus for multiple commercial applications. Out of these forms, helical turbine offers many distinctive advantages such as unidirectional motion, reduced pulsation as well as increased operating power and strength. However, manufacturing of helical blades for such turbines is quite a costly and cumbersome affair. Due to this reason, many attempts have been made in the past to convert one turbine form into other, so as to create a novel design with all beneficial features, sidelining limitations. This novel approach enables development and use of a universal spherical turbine which works as a helical form (retaining its beneficial features) with spherical configuration.",

An example of how hydrogen would be used in this new economy is via proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. PEM fuel cells operating on pure hydrogen have excellent energy and power capabilities. However, producing pure hydrogen from water using electrolysis is not economical. This invention involves a new process for combining electrolysis and thermal chemistry to economically produce hydrogen.",

    "description": "UW–Madison researchers have developed a device and a method for measuring rheological properties of fluid that will effectively determine the yield stress of biomass materials. These measurements do not alter the material sample prior to measurement, allowing for more accurate data results and characterization. The device comprises a cavity for receiving the fluid, an auger connected with an axial shaft, and a load cell sensor connected to the auger. The sensor measures the force on the auger from the fluid as the auger moves up and down. A linkage interconnected to the sensor translates motion to the auger.",

    "description": "A wind turbine generator, in order to maintain an appropriate rotation speed of the rotor, electric energy to be taken out from the generator is regularly controlled according to the wind strength. In this control process, the torque of the rotor may fluctuate and become a vibration source. As the rotor is located on the tower which is elongate and low in rigidity, when the vibration caused by a fluctuation in torque synchronizes with the resonance frequency of the tower, the vibration may develop into a vibration of the entire windmill. Besides the fluctuation in torque due to rotation control of the rotor, vibration of a windmill is caused by various types of vibrations such as vibration due to a Karman vortex generated by the tower, resonance of the speed-increasing gear, the rotor, the generator and the drive axis, and vibration due to bending or torsion of the construction. The present technology provides a wind turbine generator that can control fluctuations in the torque loaded on the rotor to suppress or prevent wind turbine vibration.",
