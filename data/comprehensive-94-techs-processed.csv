Out of these forms, helical turbine offers many distinctive advantages such as unidirectional motion, reduced pulsation as well as increased operating power and strength. However, manufacturing of helical blades for such turbines is quite a costly and cumbersome affair. Due to this reason, many attempts have been made in the past to convert one turbine form into other, so as to create a novel design with all beneficial features, sidelining limitations. This novel approach enables development and use of a universal spherical turbine which works as a helical form (retaining its beneficial features) with spherical configuration.","Less mechanical wear, higher efficiency, and lower cost as well as improvement of power system transient stability.",N/A,,,,,叶片技术;球形设计,电力系统用偏轴球形通用涡轮机,清洁能源技术,风能技术
