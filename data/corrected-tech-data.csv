Flexibile foundations for earthquake-proof offshore wind power,171988,J-Power,2025/04/30,2025/05/30,https://www.jpower.co.jp/english/,https://thumbnails.wipogreen.wipo.int/171988,"The 'Flexible Tripile' foundation addresses challenges posed by the shallow, hard bedrock common in Japanese waters, where traditional monopile foundations may be unsuitable. The new design consists of three piles connected to a central steel main pipe supporting the turbine tower via a base plate. This base plate incorporates square steel pipes, steel plates, and wire ropes, creating a flexible structure that deforms relatively easily. The design provides seismic isolation, allowing the turbine to sway slowly, preventing vibrations, and avoiding resonance-amplified oscillations during earthquakes. Joint research with Professor ISHIHARA Takeshi of the University of Tokyo and model experiments have, according to the company, confirmed the innovation's effectiveness and demonstrated the foundation's enhanced vibration damping compared to conventional designs.","Greenhouse gases, Electricity",N/A,日本,日本,Technology development / prototype (TRL 5-6),无特定IP信息,柔性基础;抗震技术,地震防护海上风电柔性三桩基础,清洁能源技术,风能技术,2025-09-01T08:31:11.149Z,WIPO Green Database,https://wipogreen.wipo.int/wipogreen-database/articles/171988,修正技术图片链接格式;修正Benefits字段内容;修正Benefits Description;精简自定义标签至2个
