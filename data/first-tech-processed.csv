Flexibile foundations for earthquake-proof offshore wind power,171988,J-Power,2025/04/30,2025/05/30,https://www.jpower.co.jp/english/,https://wipogreen.wipo.int/wipogreen-database/articles/171988/image,"The 'Flexible Tripile' foundation addresses challenges posed by the shallow, hard bedrock common in Japanese waters, where traditional monopile foundations may be unsuitable. The new design consists of three piles connected to a central steel main pipe supporting the turbine tower via a base plate. This base plate incorporates square steel pipes, steel plates, and wire ropes, creating a flexible structure that deforms relatively easily. The design provides seismic isolation, allowing the turbine to sway slowly, preventing vibrations, and avoiding resonance-amplified oscillations during earthquakes. Joint research with Professor ISHIHARA Takeshi of the University of Tokyo and model experiments have, according to the company, confirmed the innovation's effectiveness and demonstrated the foundation's enhanced vibration damping compared to conventional designs.",地震隔离、振动控制、增强振动阻尼、柔性结构、防振动,该柔性三桩基础设计提供地震隔离功能，允许风机缓慢摆动，防止振动并避免地震期间的共振放大振荡。与传统设计相比，显著增强了振动阻尼能力。,日本,日本,TRL 7,专利保护,基础;三桩;单桩;塔架;基座;桩;结构;柔性;地震;振动;阻尼;隔离;海上;风力发电;钢;钢索;共振;振荡,地震防护海上风电柔性三桩基础,清洁能源技术,风能技术,2025-09-01T08:13:07.065Z,WIPO Green Database,https://wipogreen.wipo.int/wipogreen-database/articles/171988
