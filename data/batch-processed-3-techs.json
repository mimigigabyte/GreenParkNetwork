    "description": "The 'Flexible Tripile' foundation addresses challenges posed by the shallow, hard bedrock common in Japanese waters, where traditional monopile foundations may be unsuitable. The new design consists of three piles connected to a central steel main pipe supporting the turbine tower via a base plate. This base plate incorporates square steel pipes, steel plates, and wire ropes, creating a flexible structure that deforms relatively easily. The design provides seismic isolation, allowing the turbine to sway slowly, preventing vibrations, and avoiding resonance-amplified oscillations during earthquakes. Joint research with Professor ISHIHARA Takeshi of the University of Tokyo and model experiments have, according to the company, confirmed the innovation's effectiveness and demonstrated the foundation's enhanced vibration damping compared to conventional designs.",

    "description": "A small wind turbine which can power your homes, farms and businesses for the next 20 years. The small wind turbine AVATAR™-1 is a multi-phase, multi-voltage, brushless generator with fiber-reinforced glass housing and tale vane with Auto Direction Positioning that can be used for rural electrification in homes and offices and for rural electrification, agriculture, and telecom towers. The startup wind speed is 1.4 m/s and peak power is 1000W. The turbines are suited to perform in diverse weather conditions and automatically face any wind direction. They are noiseless, with less than 10% of the sound of the wind itself at foundation level. The operational lifetime is 20 years.",
