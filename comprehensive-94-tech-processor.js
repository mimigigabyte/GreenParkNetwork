Out of these forms, helical turbine offers many distinctive advantages such as unidirectional motion, reduced pulsation as well as increased operating power and strength. However, manufacturing of helical blades for such turbines is quite a costly and cumbersome affair. Due to this reason, many attempts have been made in the past to convert one turbine form into other, so as to create a novel design with all beneficial features, sidelining limitations.
