The new design consists of three piles connected to a central steel main pipe supporting the turbine tower via a base plate. This base plate incorporates square steel pipes, steel plates, and wire ropes, creating a flexible structure that deforms relatively easily. The design provides seismic isolation, allowing the turbine to sway slowly, preventing vibrations, and avoiding resonance-amplified oscillations during earthquakes. Joint research with Professor ISHIHARA Takeshi of the University of Tokyo and model experiments have, according to the company, confirmed the innovation's effectiveness and demonstrated the foundation's enhanced vibration damping compared to conventional designs.", "benefits": "Greenhouse gases, Electricity", "benefitsDescription": "N/A", "developedInCountry": "Japan", "deployedInCountry": "Japan", "technologyReadinessLevel": "Technology development / prototype (TRL 5-6)", "intellectualProperty": ""},

The small wind turbine AVATAR™-1 is a multi-phase, multi-voltage, brushless generator with fiber-reinforced glass housing and tale vane with Auto Direction Positioning that can be used for rural electrification in homes and offices and for rural electrification, agriculture, and telecom towers. The startup wind speed is 1.4 m/s and peak power is 1000W. The turbines are suited to perform in diverse weather conditions and automatically face any wind direction. They are noiseless, with less than 10% of the sound of the wind itself at foundation level.

  {"id": "171985", "benefits": "Greenhouse gases, Electricity", "companyName": "ZONHAN", "description": "This small turbine is designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions, such as strong winds and cold temperatures, with a rated output of 5 kW at 10.5 m/s. Its tower is made from strong cast steel, and the reinforced blades feature a variable pitch mechanism ensuring stable and efficient operation even past the rated wind speed. This is passively activated as soon as wind speeds exceed 11 m/s, forcing the blades into a negative angle and thus limiting rotor rotation speed. This way, output power remains 5 kW at speeds up to 25 m/s, whereas start and security wind speeds are at 3 and 50 m/s, respectively.", "updatedDate": "2025/05/30", "publishedDate": "2025/04/30", "technologyNameEN": "Variable pitch turbine for homes", "companyWebsiteUrl": "https://www.zonhan.com/en/product/5KW-Variable-Pitch-Wind-turbine.html", "deployedInCountry": "", "developedInCountry": "", "benefitsDescription": "", "intellectualProperty": "", "technologyReadinessLevel": ""},

The developer, Longyuan, is a subsidiary of CHN Energy and aims to develop a scalable solution in the region where off-shore aquaculture is common and floating energy platforms rapidly are gaining momentum. This first platform, called Guoneng Shared, consists of a 4-MW wind turbine and a 10,000 cubic meter net cage. The site has been equipped with a complete set of deep-sea aquaculture equipment, including sensors for remote monitoring and operation.

  {"id": "146724", "benefits": "Greenhouse gases, Electricity", "companyName": "University of Arizona / Tech Launch Arizona", "description": "This technology is a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) with active flow control which delays the occurrence of dynamic-stall, widens the operational envelope, and increases the performance of the vertical axis wind turbine. Professor Wygnanski at the University of Arizona's Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering developed an improved design for a lift-type VAWT. This improved VAWT design removes the central column whose wake generates unwanted vibrations, and it incorporates features that translate into a wider operational envelope for the turbine while also minimizing wear of the bottom bearing. The improved operational envelope is a combination of the new VAWT design, and the use of active flow control to delay the occurrence of dynamic-stall experienced with the Darrieus VAWT. The VAWT is most suitable to floating installations that do not obstruct the shore line where HAWT cannot be realistically installed.", "updatedDate": "2023/03/07", "publishedDate": "2022/08/12", "technologyNameEN": "Vertical Axis Wind Turbine With Active Flow Controls", "companyWebsiteUrl": "https://inventions.arizona.edu/tech/Vertical_Axis_Wind_Turbine_With_Active_Flow_Controls", "deployedInCountry": "", "developedInCountry": "USA", "benefitsDescription": "This technology contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by providing a renewable source of electricity generation from wind, which is a clean and sustainable energy source.", "intellectualProperty": "", "technologyReadinessLevel": ""},
  {"id": "138694", "benefits": "Greenhouse gases, Electricity", "companyName": "Hitachi, Ltd.", "description": "In recent years, with the aim of achieving both environmental protection and economic growth, the share of renewable energy sources in the world's energy mix has been growing rapidly. In response to this global trend, we have been developing downwind wind power generation system. This development is based on free yaw, which is a characteristic of the downwind type with the rotor located on the downwind side, and achieves load reduction, high power generation efficiency, and improved reliability during high wind speeds such as typhoons. The characteristics of downwind, which are different from the general upwind, are attracting international attention. For example, the developed HTW5.2-127 is shown in Fig. 1. In this wind power generation system, with 5.2 MW rated output and a rotor with 127m in diameter, blade-supporting rotor is placed on the downwind side of the nacelle and tower, which is called as \"downwind type\". The downwind power generation system has the following features in its configuration, and by taking advantage of the effects, the reliability of this wind power generation system has been improved.", "updatedDate": "2021/10/12", "publishedDate": "2021/09/29", "technologyNameEN": "Downwind Turbine System", "companyWebsiteUrl": "https://www.hitachi.com/products/energy/wind/index.html", "deployedInCountry": "", "developedInCountry": "", "benefitsDescription": "The downwind turbine system contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by utilizing renewable wind energy for electricity generation, thus promoting sustainable energy solutions.", "intellectualProperty": "", "technologyReadinessLevel": ""},
